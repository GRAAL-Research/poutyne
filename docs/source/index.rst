Here is Poutyne
===============

Poutyne is a Keras-like framework for `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and handles much of the boilerplating code needed to train neural networks.

Use Poutyne to:

- Train models easily.
- Use callbacks to save your best model, perform early stopping and much more.

Read the documentation at `Poutyne.org <https://poutyne.org>`_.

Poutyne is compatible with the **latest version of PyTorch** and  **Python >= 3.5**.

Getting started: few seconds to Poutyne
=======================================

The core data structure of Poutyne is a :class:`~poutyne.framework.Model`, a way to train your own `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html>`_ neural networks.

How Poutyne works is that you create your `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html>`_ module (neural network) as usual but when comes the time to train it you feed it into the Poutyne Model, which handles all the steps, stats and callbacks, similar to what `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_ does.

Here is a simple example:

.. code-block:: python

  # Import the Poutyne Model and define a toy dataset
  from poutyne.framework import Model
  import torch
  import numpy as np

  num_features = 20
  num_classes = 5

  num_train_samples = 800
  train_x = np.random.randn(num_train_samples, num_features).astype('float32')
  train_y = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=num_train_samples).astype('int64')

  num_valid_samples = 200
  valid_x = np.random.randn(num_valid_samples, num_features).astype('float32')
  valid_y = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=num_valid_samples).astype('int64')

  num_test_samples = 200
  test_x = np.random.randn(num_test_samples, num_features).astype('float32')
  test_y = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=num_test_samples).astype('int64')


Create yourself a `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html>`_ network:

.. code-block:: python

  pytorch_module = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)


You can now use Poutyne's model to train your network easily:

.. code-block:: python

  model = Model(pytorch_module, 'sgd', 'cross_entropy',
                batch_metrics=['accuracy'], epoch_metrics=['f1'])
  model.fit(
      train_x, train_y,
      validation_data=(valid_x, valid_y),
      epochs=5,
      batch_size=32
  )


This is really similar to the `model.compile <https://keras.io/models/model/#compile>`_ and `model.fit <https://keras.io/models/model/#fit>`_ functions as in `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_.


You can evaluate the performances of your network using the ``evaluate`` method of Poutyne's model:

.. code-block:: python

  loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(test_x, test_y)


Or only predict on new data:

.. code-block:: python

  predictions = model.predict(test_x)


As you can see, Poutyne is inspired a lot by the friendliness of `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_. See the Poutyne documentation at `Poutyne.org <https://poutyne.org/>`_ for more.

Why this name, Poutyne?
=======================

Poutyne (or poutine in Québécois) is now the well-known dish from Quebec composed of French fries, squeaky cheese curds and brown gravy. However, in Quebec, it also has the meaning of something that is an `"ordinary or common subject or activity" <https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/poutine>`_. Thus, Poutyne will get rid of the ordinary boilerplate code that plain `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ training usually entails.
