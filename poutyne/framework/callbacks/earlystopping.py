    Stop training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving.

    Args:
        monitor (str): Quantity to be monitored.
        min_delta (float): Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement,
            i.e. an absolute change of less than min_delta, will count as no improvement.
            (Default value = 0)
        patience (int): Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
            (Default value = 0)
        verbose (bool): Whether to print when early stopping is done.
            (Default value = False)
        mode (str): One of {'min', 'max'}. In `min` mode, training will stop when the quantity
            monitored has stopped decreasing; in `max` mode it will stop when the quantity monitored has
            stopped increasing.
