    "In **stochastic gradient descent**, a **batch** of `m` examples are drawn from the train dataset. In the so-called forward pass, these examples are passed through the neural network and an average of their loss values is done. In the backward pass, the average loss is backpropagated through the network to compute the gradient of each parameter. In practice, the `m` examples of a batch are drawn without replacement. Thus, we define one **epoch** of training being the number of batches needed to loop through the entire training dataset.\n",

To do so, you should either increase or decrease the temperature during the optimization. As one will see in the result, temperature either as no effect or has detrimental effect on the performance of the neural network. This is so because the temperature has for effect to artificially changing the learning rates. Since we have found the right learning rate, increasing or decreasing it shows no improvement on the results."

    "# Poutyne Experiment\n",
    "Most of the time when using Poutyne (or even Pytorch in general), we will find ourselves in an iterative model hyperparameters finetuning loop. For efficient model search, we will usually wish to save our best performing models, their training and testing statistics and even sometimes wish to retrain an already trained model for further tuning. All of the above can be easily implemented with the flexibility of Poutyne Callbacks, but having to define and initialize each and every Callback object we wish for our model quickly feels cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Poutyne provides an [Experiment class](https://poutyne.org/experiment.html), which aims specifically at enabling quick model iteration search, while not sacrifying on the quality of a single experiment - statistics logging, best models saving, etc. Experiment is actually a simple wrapper between a Pytorch module and Poutyne's core Callback objects for logging and saving. Given a working directory where to output the various logging files and a Pytorch module, the Experiment class reduces the whole training loop to a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code should use [Poutyne's Experiment class](https://poutyne.org/experiment.html) to train a network for 5 epochs. The code should be quite simpler than the code in the Poutyne Callbacks section while doing more (only 3 lines). Once trained for 5 epochs, it is then possible to resume the optimization at the 5th epoch for 5 more epochs until the 10th epoch using the same function."
